# Address Book Web Service UI
##### Built using React

## Notes

- I built it using React because I, personally, always wanted to start working with a solid UI framework, and react seems to be the most recommended :D
- Referred to this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4UZrsTqkcW4&t=4s) to learn react and implement the best I can by today.
- The UI is just a POC that demonstrates how I would go about building the application, and it only contains 1 API call to one of the API endpoints developed in the backend that retrieves the data.

## Features Implemented

- **POC to demonstrate the data**: As mentioned before, the application is simply to showcase how I would start doing it, and it shows the people retrieved from the first page only in a CSS-less table.

## Features NOT Implemented
Below are the features I did not have time to implement due to the timing constraint and not knowing the basic of a UI framework (React).
- **Add forms for updating, creating and deleting entries**: The Api is implemented from the backend for this, but not from the frontend part.
- **Add input fields to search for people**
- **Make pagination dynamic based on input fields**
